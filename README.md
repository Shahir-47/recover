# Recover

**Recover** is a forensic recovery program written in C that extracts JPEG files from a forensic image. It scans a memory card image file (`card.raw`), identifies JPEG files by their unique signatures, and reconstructs them into separate `.jpg` files. Initially, the directory may appear to have no JPEG images, but once the program runs, recovered images will populate the directory.

## üìñ Background

When photos are deleted from a memory card, they are not truly erased. Instead, they are marked as "forgotten," leaving their raw data intact until overwritten. This program scans a forensic image of a memory card (`card.raw`), identifies JPEG files by their unique signatures, and reconstructs them into separate `.jpg` files.

JPEG files are identified by their specific signature:
- The first three bytes: `0xff 0xd8 0xff`
- The fourth byte: A value ranging from `0xe0` to `0xef` (the first four bits are `1110`).

The program operates in 512-byte blocks, as memory cards often use a block size of 512 bytes due to FAT file systems. Each JPEG starts on a block-aligned boundary.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Command-Line Input**:
   - The program requires one command-line argument specifying the forensic image (e.g., `card.raw`) to process.
   - Example usage: `./recover card.raw`

2. **File Reading**:
   - The program reads the input file in 512-byte chunks (blocks).

3. **JPEG Detection**:
   - Each block is analyzed to check if it begins with a JPEG signature (`0xff 0xd8 0xff` and `0xe0`‚Äì`0xef`).
   - If a JPEG signature is found, the program creates a new `.jpg` file to store the image data.

4. **File Writing**:
   - All subsequent blocks are written to the current `.jpg` file until another JPEG signature is encountered, signaling the start of a new file.

5. **Output**:
   - Each recovered JPEG is saved in the current directory as `###.jpg` (e.g., `000.jpg`, `001.jpg`, etc.), where `###` is a three-digit number.

## üõ† Installation

### Install the CS50 Library

Before running the program, ensure you have the **CS50 library** installed. Follow the instructions based on your operating system:

#### Ubuntu
```bash
$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/cs50/repo/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
$ sudo apt install libcs50
```

#### Fedora
```bash
$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/cs50/repo/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
$ sudo dnf install libcs50
```

#### From Source (Linux and Mac)
1. Download the latest release from [CS50 Library Releases](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded file:
   ```bash
   tar -xvf libcs50-*.tar.gz
   cd libcs50-*
   sudo make install
   ```

---

## üíª Usage

### Compile the Code
Use the `gcc` compiler to build the program with the CS50 library:
```bash
gcc -o recover recover.c -lcs50
```

### Run the Program
Provide the forensic image file (`card.raw`) as an argument:
```bash
./recover card.raw
```

---

## üß™ Example

**Initial State**:  
The directory appears empty with no JPEG files.

**After Running the Program**:
```bash
$ ./recover card.raw
```

Recovered files:
```
000.jpg
001.jpg
002.jpg
...
049.jpg
```

These files represent the recovered JPEGs from the forensic image.

## üîç Code Overview

### Key Sections of the Code

1. **Command-Line Validation**:
   - Ensures the correct usage of the program with a single argument.

2. **JPEG Detection**:
   - Identifies the start of a JPEG using the signature:
     ```c
     if (pic[0] == 0xff && pic[1] == 0xd8 && pic[2] == 0xff && (pic[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0)
     ```

3. **File Management**:
   - Writes data to a new `.jpg` file each time a JPEG signature is detected:
     ```c
     sprintf(imagename, "%03i.jpg", jpfound);
     image = fopen(imagename, "w");
     fwrite(pic, 512, 1, image);
     ```

4. **Memory Safety**:
   - Ensures all files are properly closed:
     ```c
     fclose(image);
     fclose(memory);
     ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Edge Cases

1. **No Command-Line Argument**:
   - The program will display usage instructions if no arguments or more than one argument is provided:
     ```bash
     $ ./recover
     Usage: ./recover image
     ```

2. **Invalid File**:
   - The program will display an error if the input file cannot be opened:
     ```bash
     $ ./recover missing.raw
     forensic image cannot be opened
     ```

3. **End of File**:
   - Ensures all files are closed once the input file has been fully processed.

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove all recovered JPEG files from the directory:
```bash
rm *.jpg
```
